<h1 style="text-align:center">Data Structures in Python</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In this repository, I primarily work with the data structures of the Python programming language. I have included solutions to 10 problems for each of the following data structures</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>List:</strong> A collection that is ordered and mutable, allowing for duplicate elements.</li>
<li><strong>Tuple:</strong> An ordered collection that is immutable, also allowing for duplicate elements.</li>
<li><strong>Set:</strong> An unordered collection of unique elements, which is mutable.</li>
<li><strong>Dictionary:</strong> A collection of key-value pairs, where keys are unique and values can be of any data type.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>
This repository contains the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Solutions to problems:</strong> Each data structure has a dedicated folder with 10 problems and their solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Basic knowledge:</strong> Essential concepts and usage of each data structure in Python.</li>
</ul>
